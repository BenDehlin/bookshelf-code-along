## setup we did outside of index/books_controller:
1. ran `npm init -y` to generate a package.json
2. ran `npm install express` to install the express package
3. created a `.gitignore` file to ignore our node_modules/ folder so we don't accidentally push it to github
4. changed the `"main"` in the `package.json` to be `server/index.js` so that we could run the nodemon command and have it correctly find our `index.js` file.

## Files that matter:
### server/index.js
### server/books_controller.js

## Both index.js and books_controller have
## extensive notes about what they are doing.
